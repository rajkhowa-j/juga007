        \item If rank$A=m$, $Q$ and $R$ are uniquely determined and the main diagonal entries of $R$ are all positive.
        \item If $m=n$, the $Q$ is unitary.
        \item There is a unitary $Q\in M_n$ and an upper triangular $R\in M_{n,m}$ with nonegative diagonal entries such that $A=QR$.

    Let $A\in M_n$ and $\epsilon>0$ be given. There is a matrix norm $\|\cdot\|$ such that $$\rho(A)\leq\|A\|\leq\rho(A)+\epsilon.$$

\begin{theorem}\label{thm3}
    Let $A\in M_n$ be given. If there is a matrix norm $\|\cdot\|$ such that $\|A\|<1$, then $\displaystyle\lim_{k\to\infty}{A^k}=0$, that is, each entry of $A^k$ tends to zero as $k\to\infty$.

\end{theorem}
\begin{remark}
    Let $R$ be the radius of convergence of a scalar power series $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}{a_kz^k}$ and let $A\in M_n$ be given such that $\rho(A)<R$, then the series $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}{a_kA^k}$ converges. Let $T_n(A)=\sum_{k=0}^{n}{a_kA^k}$ then $\lim_{k\to\infty}{T_n}(A)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}{a_kA^k}$. Let $x\neq 0$ such that $Ax=\mu x$. Then $$T_n(A)x=\left(\sum_{k=0}^{n}{a_kA^k}\right)x=\sum_{k=0}^{n}{a_k(A^kx)}=\sum_{k=0}^{n}{a_k(\mu^kx)}=\left(\sum_{k=0}^{n}{a_k\mu^k}\right)x=T_n(\mu)x.$$
    Since $\mu<R$ so the series $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}{a_k\mu^k}$ converges and hence $\left(\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}{a_kA^k}\right)x=\left(\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}{a_k\mu^k}\right)x$.
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
    Let $A\in M_n$, $p_A$ be the characteristic polynomial of $A$ and let $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_n$ are the eigenvalues of $A$. Then $$p_A(t)=(t-\lambda_1)(t-\lambda_2)\cdots(t-\lambda_n),$$
    i.e., $$p_A(t)=t^n-S_1(A)t^{n-1}+S_2(A)t^{n-2}+\cdots+(-1)^{n-1}S_{n-1}(A)t+(-1)^nS_n(A).$$

\begin{theorem}[\textbf{The Perronâ€“Frobenius Theorem}]
    Any square matrix with positive entries has a unique eigenvector with positive entries (up to a multiplication by a positive scalar), and the corresponding eigenvalue has multiplicity one and is strictly greater than the absolute value of any other eigenvalue.

    Let $R$ be a UFD with field of fraction $F$ and let $p(x)\in R[x]$. If $p(x)$ is reducible in $F[x]$ then $p(x)$ is reducible in $R[x]$. More precisely, if $p(x)=A(x)B(x)$ for some nonconstant polynomials $A(x), B(x)\in F[x]$, then there are nonzero elements $r,s\in F$ such that $rA(x)=a(x)$ and $sB(x)=b(x)$ both lie in $R[x]$ and $p(x)=a(x)b(x)$ is a factorization in $R[x]$.

\begin{theorem}
    Let $R$ be a UFD, let $F$ be the field of fractions and let $p(x)\in R[x]$. Suppose that gcd of the coefficients of $p(x)$ is 1. Then $p(x)$ is irreducible in $R[x]$ if and only if it is irreducible in $F[x]$. In particular, if $p(x)$ is a monic polynomial that is irreducible in $R[x]$, then $p(x)$ is irreducible in $F[x]$.

In particular, if $p(x)$ is a monic polynomial with integer coefficients and $p(d)\neq0$ for all integer $d$ dividing $a_0$, then $p(x)$ has no roots in $\Q$.

    Let $I$ be a proper ideal in the integral domain $R$ and let $p(x)$ be a nonconstant monic polynomial in $R[x]$. If the image of $p(x)$ in $(R/I)[x]$ cannot be factored in $(R/I)[x]$ into two polynomials of smaller degree, then $p(x)$ is irreducible in $R[x]$. (Converse need not be true, for example let $R=\Z, I_1=3\Z, I_2=2\Z$ and $p(x)=x^2+1$ then p is irreducible in $\Z$ as it is irreducible in $(R/I_1)[x]$ but is reducible in $(R/I_2)[x]$).

    Let $P$ be a prime ideal of the integral domain $R$ and let $f(x)=x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_0$ be a polynomial in $R[x]$. Suppose $a_{n-1},\ldots, a_1, a_0$ are all elements of $P$ and suppose that $a_0$ is not an element of $P^2$. Then $f(x)$ is irreducible in $R[x]$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[\textbf{Eisenstein's Criterion for integer polynomials}]
    Let $P$ be a prime in $\Z$ and let $f(x)=x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_0\in\Z[x]$, $n\geq 1$. Suppose that $p$ divides $a_i$ for all $i\in\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}$ but that $p^2$ does not divide $a_0$. Then $f(x)$ is both irreducible in $\Z[x]$ and $\Q[x]$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
    The maximal ideals in $F[x]$ are the ideals $(f(x))$ generated by irreducible polynomials $f(x)$. In particular, $F[x]/(f(x))$ is a field if and only if $f(x)$ is irreducible.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
    Let $g(x)$ be a nonconstant monic element of $F[x]$ and let

\subsection{Spliting field of $x^n-1$}
In any spliting field $K$ over $\Q$ for $x^n-1$ the collection of $n^{\text{th}}$ roots of unity form a group under multiplication since if $x^n=1$ and $y^n=1$ then $(xy)^n=1$. It follows that this is a cyclic group.
\begin{definition}
    A generator of the cyclic group of $n^{\text{th}}$ root of unity is called a \textbf{primitive} $n^{\text{th}}$ root of unity.
\end{definition}
Let $\zeta_n$ denote that primitive $n^{\text{th}}$ root of unity then other primitive $n^{\text{th}}$ roots of unity are the elements $\zeta^a_n$ where $1\leq a<n$ and $(a,n)=1$, since these are the generators for a cyclic group of order $n$. In particular, there are precisely $\psi(n)$ primitive $n^{\text{th}}$ roots of unity, where, $\psi(n)$ denote the Eular $\psi$- function.
\begin{definition}
    The spliting field of $x^n-1$ over $\Q$, $\Q(\zeta_n)$ is called the cyclotomic field of $n^{\text{th}}$ roots of unity.
\end{definition}
\textbf{Note:} When $n=p$ is a prime,
$$x^p-1=(x-1)(x^{p-1}+x^{p-2}+\cdots+1)$$
and since $\zeta_p\neq 1$ it follows that $\zeta_p$ is a root of the polynomial
$$\Phi_p(x)=\frac{x^p-1}{x-1}=x^{p-1}+x^{p-2}+\cdots+1$$
which is irreducible. It follows that $\Phi_p(x)$ is the minimal polynomial of $\zeta_p$ over $\Q$, so that $[\Q(\zeta_p):\Q]=p-1$.

\subsection{Spliting field of $x^p-2$, where $p$ is prime}

Let $p$ be a prime and consider the spliting field of $x^p-2$. If ${\alpha}^p-2=0$ then $(\zeta\alpha)^p-2=0$, where $\zeta$ is any $p^{\text{th}}$ root of unity. Hence the solutions of this equation are $$\zeta \sqrt[^p]{2},\,\,\,\zeta\,\,\,p^{\text{th}}\,\,\,\text{root of unity}$$
where $\sqrt[^p]{2}$ denote the positive real $p^{\text{th}}$ root of 2 if we use to view these elements as complex numbers, and denote any one solutions of $x^p-2$ if we these roots abstractly. Clearly, the spliting field of $x^p-2$ over $\Q$ contains $\Q(\sqrt[^p]{2},\zeta_p)$. On the other hand, all the roots above lie in $\Q(\sqrt[^p]{2},\zeta_p)$, so that the spliting field if precisely $\Q(\sqrt[^p]{2},\zeta_p)$.\\
$\Q(\sqrt[^p]{2},\zeta_p)$ contains $\Q(\zeta_p)$ and it is generated over it by $\sqrt[^p]{2}$, hence is an extension of degree at most $p$. If follows that the degree of this extension over $\Q$ is $\leq p(p-1)$.
$$[\Q(\sqrt[^p]{2},\zeta_p):\Q]\leq[\Q(\sqrt[^p]{2},\zeta_p):\Q(\zeta_p)][\Q(\zeta_p):\Q]=p(p-1)$$
so we have $[\Q(\sqrt[^p]{2},\zeta_p):\Q]=p(p-1)$ as $(p,p-1)=1$.
\subsection{Finite Fields}
\begin{theorem}
    Let $p$ be a prime integer, and let $q=p^r$ be a positive power of $p$.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Let $K$ be a field of order $q$. The elements of $K$ are roots of the polynomial $x^q-x$.
        \item The irreducible factors of the polynomial $x^q-x$ over the prime field $F=\mathbb{F}_p$ are the irreducible polynomials in $F[x]$ whose degrees divide $r$.
        \item Let $K$ be a field of order $q$. The multiplicative group $K^{\times}$ of nonzero elements of $K$ is a cyclic group of order $q-1$.
        \item There exists a field of order $q$, and all fields of order $q$ are isomorphic.
        \item A field of order $p^r$ contains a subfield of order $p^k$ if and only if $k$ divide $r$.
    \end{enumerate}

    A \textbf{representation} of a group is a homomorphism of the group into a group of matrices. A representation is called \textbf{irreducible} if there does not exist a basis in which it can be decomposed into blocks. Any representation of a finite group is the block sum of irreducible representations. The simplest representation, called the trivial representation, sends all elements of the group to the identity element. \textbf{For any nontrivial irreducible representation of a finite group $G$, the sum of the matrices of the representation is zero}.

\begin{definition}
    A function is called convex if any segment with endpoints on its graph lies above the graph itself. Formally, if $D$ is an interval of the real axis, or more generally a convex subset of a vector space, then a function $f:D\to\R$ is called convex if
